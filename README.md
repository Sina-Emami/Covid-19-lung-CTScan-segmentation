<h4>Histogram equalization</h4>
Histogram equalization has been used since this method usually increases the global contrast of many images, especially when the image is represented by a narrow range of intensity values. Histogram equalization often produces unrealistic effects in photographs; however it is very useful for scientific images like x-ray and CT-scan.
